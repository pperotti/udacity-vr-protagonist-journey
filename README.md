# OVERVIEW
 
## The Protagonist's Journey
 
### INTRODUCTION
This work is part of one of the tasks that needs to be presented part of the VR Nanodegree. 
 
the topic I choose to do for this journey was to create a documentary but with a modern way to deal with it. The documentary will take the form of a city tour between a local tour guide and two visitors, one that can be seen in the film and the other one the person watching this film. The key differentiator here with other potential documentaries is the fact that I plan to make this tour interactive, which means that while staying a each of the different location, there will be points that can be selectable by the user offering the unique opportunity to observe close-ups or details that the real visitor simple can't.
 
### DOCUMENTS DELIVERED
There are 4 areas each of one will have associated material:
1. The script: All the information shown in the film is defined in the script including the questions made by the real visitor.
2. The storyboard: With this document you should be able to understand how the interactions should happen.
3. The plan: This document let the reader understand all the tasks that are required to complete the true video.
4. The extra material: I like the idea of the city tour so much that I took a real tour and shooted in 360 with 2 360 cámeras (Ricoh Theta S and Gear S - first edition -). The purpose of this material is to use it later on in the next project. The video presented will give the audience a true idea and understanding of the locations and places. 

### ABOUT THE CONTENTS
The written information is all public since it is history but videos should not be used without the consent of the tour guide consent. The author of this material (Pablo Perotti) is the visitor and camera man in all this video.
